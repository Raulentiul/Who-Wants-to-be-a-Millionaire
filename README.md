# Who wants to be a Millionaire game in Java
## Short description of the project:
This game was done using **JavaFX** and a connection to an **Oracle** Database. It contains a LogIn and a CreateAccount page, and there are two types of users: players and admins (the role is given through the database). If the user is Logs as an admin, they can add a question to the database, but as a player, the game will be initialized. 

The game features the three lifelines: FiftyFifty, AskAudience and PhoneFriend. 

Unlike the television game, this one stops if the player fiinishes all the questions that are in the database.
